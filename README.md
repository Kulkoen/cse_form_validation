# Purpose
These are some scripts to automate the form validation at my part-time job. Mostly just looking at CSV files for the most part.

# Run Instructions
1. Is this the first time you are using script or has it been awhile since youâ€™ve used it?
    1. Yes, go to step 2
    2. No, go to step 3
2. Download Eligible Advisors List, Advisor Forms, and Officer Onboarding CSV files and put files in the same directory
3. Rename files to ```AdvisorEligibility.csv```, ```AdvisorForm.csv```, and ```OfficerOnboarding.csv```.
4. Run script for those AR forms using ```./process.sh```
5. Review output in terminal

# Future Plans
- Implement a GUI
- Include more forms
- Improve output visualization
